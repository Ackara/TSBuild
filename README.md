TSBuild
======================================================================

You want to use Typescript to compile to Javascript, as well as
minifying said Javascript. However when you minify the compiled
Javascript __the source-map files used for debugging, do not 
get mapped to the original typescript source files__.
TSBuild is the solution.  

TSBuild is a tool that compile and minify your typescript files at
the same time, while retaining the proper source-map mappings to the
typescript files.
